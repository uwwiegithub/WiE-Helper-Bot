# WiE-Helper-Bot

Bot to help make internal processes easier within the Women in Engineering community!

## 3 features
1. add member to a subteam role (/assign_role)
2. remove member from a subteam role (/unassign_role)
3. view all members + their subteam role (/subteam_info)

## How To Run
1. ```git clone``` the repository to your local machine
2. make sure you have python installed
3. Replace the secret key token with the actual token found on Notion (we should really migrate this to use .env, someone do that please)
4. run ```python main.py```
